\chapter{Mapping BPMN to Jiac AgentBeans}

The element mapping from BPMN to Jiac AgentBeans is created based on the existing mapping to JiacV - JADL script. This chapter will provide a tabular overview of the mapping. 

\textbf{Business Process Diagram}

\begin{table*}[hp]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline\hline
			\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Business Process Diagram}} \\\hline\hline
			 Pool & A pool is currently mapped to a Java-File containing a Jiac AgentBean.\\\hline
			 Process & ...\\\hline
			 Lane & Lanes will not be mapped in this mapping\\\hline \hline
		\end{tabular}
\end{table*}\\\\

\textbf{Events}
\begin{table*}[hp]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline\hline
			\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Start Events}} \\\hline\hline
			 Timer & The generated process will be started in the execute() method of the JIAC AgentBean\\\hline
			 Message & If the implementation is a Service, an action will be created, and the process can be started through a service call (invoke). If the implementation is a Message Channel, a Space Observer will be attached to the agents memory, and the process will start as soon as a message is recieved.\\\hline
			 Rule & Rule start events are not regarded in the current mapping\\\hline
			 Link & \\\hline
			 Multiple & If a pool has multiple start events, each start event will be mapped according to it's respective trigger\\\hline\hline
