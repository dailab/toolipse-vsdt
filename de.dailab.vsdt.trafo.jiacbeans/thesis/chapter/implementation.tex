\chapter{Implementation of the transformation}
\label{chap:implementation}

In this chapter, some details of the transformation implementation will be presented. As mentioned before in section \ref{sec:vsdt}, the transformation process in the VSDT is divided into 5 stages. We've also mentioned that the default validation and structure mapping provided by the transformation framework are reuseable. The stages of the implemented transformation to Jiac AgentBeans is shown on Figure \ref{fig:implementation_stages}
