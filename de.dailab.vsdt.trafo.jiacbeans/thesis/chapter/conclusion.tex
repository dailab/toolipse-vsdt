\section{Future Work}

\textbf{Complete the missing Mapping concepts}\\
The mapping discussed in chapter \ref{chap:mapping} is not complete. 

\textbf{Solve the open issues in the implementation}\\
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:opi}, there are some open issues in the implementation that needs to be solved. Most of these issues can be solved easily and should be done in a near future. 

\textbf{JET2}\\
We have successfully implement the transformation using the older Version of JET. For the future, considerations have to be made whether it is possible and beneficial to migrate into JET2. 

\textbf{Roundtripping}\\
It would be very nice if the model and the generated Java code are kept in sync like the Wade-workflow. To achieve this on

\textbf{Data type definition}\\
As mentioned in chapter \ref{chap:examples} and in \cite{TKMLAH2010}, currently data types cannot be defined in the BPMN model. They can only be included and must exist prior to the transformation.
