	\begin{abstract}
		% Problem
		Different mappings from processes to agents have been proposed, but using
		restricted process models or targeting only single agents, none of them
		is very convincing.
		% Motivation
		This is a pity, since business processes have many notions in common with
		agents and would be well suited for modelling complex multi-agent systems.
		% Solution
		In this paper, we combine two of the existing approaches, namely WADE and
		the mapping from BPMN to JADL, to a mapping from BPMN to JIAC Agent Beans.
		% Contribution
		The resulting Agent Beans are well-structured and extensible, and at the
		same time account for nearly all of the expressiveness of BPMN.
