\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

% implementiert in Diplomarbeit, als Erweiterung zu bestehendem Tool VSDT
The mapping has been implemented in the course of the diploma thesis of one of
the authors of this paper~\cite{tan2011dipl} and is an extension to the BPMN
editor \emph{VSDT (Visual Service Design Tool)}~\cite{kuester2008vsdt}.

% kurze Beschreibung des Trafo-Frameworks, Strukturierung
The first step in mapping BPMN to Agent Beans -- or any structured programming
language -- is to structure the process graph to a tree of sequences, decision
blocks, loops, etc.  This functionality is provided by the VSDT's transformation
framework, so that only the actual mapping of individual process elements to
fragments of Java code, as specified in the last section, had to be implemented.

% Zwischenmodell fuer Agent Beans und Transformation zu Java Code per JET
This element mapping has been separated into two stages.  First, the structured
process model is translated to an intermediate model, being a high-level
representation of the structure of a JIAC Agent Bean.  Then, this model can be
translated straightforwardly to executable Java code using a number of templates
for the JET framework.\footnote{JET (Java Emitter Templates) is part of the
Eclipse Model To Text (M2T) project: \url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/m2t/}}
Using JET and JMerge, parts of the generated code can safely be modified and
merged in case the process model changes and has be be re-generated.
