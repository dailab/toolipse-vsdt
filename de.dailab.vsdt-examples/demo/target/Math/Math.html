		Process Diagrams to be transformed to both BPEL and JIAC
		
		<h2 id="_fkHEAIaSEd6vMcmgfX7H1A">Extract Root</h2>
		<span class='gen_doc'>This diagram contains a few pools representing simple algorithms. While algorithms surely are not a typical usecase for BPMN, they do well for presenting the capabilities of the VSDT. The algorithms can equally well be translated to BPEL and JIAC, they can be interpreted by the VSDT's built-in interpreter and a textual representation can be generated.</span>
		
		<h3 id="_mkhLsIaSEd6vMcmgfX7H1A">Mathematican</h3>
		The Pool '<em>Mathematican</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Mathematican</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'>In this process the square root of the input value is approximated.</span>
		The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>private</span>. In that Process,  a number of elements are executed in sequence. 
		<div class='gen_block'>
			First,  in Event '<em>start</em>' the Message '<em>GetSquareRootRequest</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.SquareRoot</em>' is received. <span class='gen_doc'>The input message is received and its payload is bound to the respective process properties.</span> 
			After that,  starting at the Gateway '<em>input valid?</em>',  one out of several branches will be accomplished: 
			<div class='gen_block'>
				If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>(number < 0) and (eps <= 0)</span>' holds true,  in Event '<em>invalid input</em>' the Message '<em>GetSquareRootResponse</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.SquareRoot</em>' is sent. <span class='gen_doc'>In case of invalid input, the return value will be zero. Further, an error message is returned.</span> 
				If no condition applies, by default  a number of elements are performed in sequence. 
				<div class='gen_block'>
					First,  the  Task '<em>initialize variables</em>' is performed. <span class='gen_doc'>This initializes the variables: The upper and lower bounds and the currently tested number.</span> 
					Afterwards,  starting at the Gateway '<em>_2</em>',  a part of the Process will be performed in a loop.  At first,  a number of elements are processed in sequence. 
					<div class='gen_block'>
						First,  the <span class='gen_type'>script</span> Task '<em>print</em>' is processed, running a script. <span class='gen_doc'>Here, the currently tested number is printed. The script's body can not be translated to BPEL, thus this works only when translating to JIAC.</span> 
						After that,  the  Task '<em>calculate delta</em>' is performed. <span class='gen_doc'>Delta is the difference between the input number and the square of the currently tested number.</span> 
						
					</div>
					After that,  the loop condition will be tested. While the condition <span class='gen_code'>((d < 0) and ((0 - d) > eps)) or ((d > 0) and (d > eps))</span> holds true, the loop will continue and  starting at the Gateway '<em>too large?</em>',  one out of several branches will be performed: 
					<div class='gen_block'>
						If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>(current * current) > number</span>' holds true,  the  Task '<em>try smaller number</em>' is conducted. <span class='gen_doc'>The currently tested number is used as the new upper bound and is then set to be the average of itself and the lower bound.</span> 
						If no condition applies, by default  the  Task '<em>try greater number</em>' is performed. <span class='gen_doc'>The currently tested number is used as the new lower bound and is then set to be the average of itself and the upper bound.</span> 
						
					</div>
					
					Afterwards,  in Event '<em>return result</em>' the Message '<em>GetSquareRootResponse</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.SquareRoot</em>' is sent. <span class='gen_doc'>Returns the result of the approximation and a success message.</span>

		The Pool '<em>Mathematican</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Mathematican</em>'. 
		The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>private</span>. In that Process,  a number of elements are conducted in sequence. 
		<div class='gen_block'>
			First,  in Event '<em>start</em>' the Message '<em>GetFacultyRequest</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.Faculty</em>' is received.  
			Afterwards,  starting at the Gateway '<em>check input</em>',  one out of several branches will be performed: 
			<div class='gen_block'>
				If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>n >= 0</span>' holds true,  a number of elements are carried out in sequence. 
				<div class='gen_block'>
					First,  a part of the Process will be accomplished in a loop.  At first,  the  Task '<em>_DO_NOTHING_</em>' is executed.  Hereupon,  the loop condition will be tested. While the condition <span class='gen_code'>n > 1</span> holds true, the loop will continue and  the  Task '<em>Multiply</em>' is performed.  
					After that, the Message '<em>GetFacultyResponse</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.Faculty</em>' is sent.  
					
				</div>
				
				If no condition applies, by default the Message '<em>GetFacultyResponse</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.Faculty</em>' is sent.
