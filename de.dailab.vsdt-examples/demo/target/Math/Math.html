Process Diagrams to be transformed to both BPEL and JIAC<br>

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<span style='color:gray'>This diagram contains a few pools representing simple algorithms. While algorithms surely are not a typical usecase for BPMN, they do well for presenting the capabilities of the VSDT. The algorithms can equally well be translated to BPEL and JIAC, they can be interpreted by the VSDT's built-in interpreter and a textual representation can be generated.</span><br>

<h3>Extract Root</h3>
<span style='color:gray'>In this process the square root of the input value is approximated.</span><br>
The Pool '<em>Extract Root</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Mathematican</em>'. The Pool's Process is of type <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>private</span>. In that Process,  a number of elements are executed in sequence. <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
	First,  in Event '<em>start</em>' the Message '<em>GetSquareRootRequest</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.SquareRoot</em>' is received. <span style='color:gray'>The input message is received and its payload is bound to the respective process properties.</span> <br>
	After that,  starting at the Gateway '<em>input valid?</em>',  one out of several branches will be carried out: <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
		If the condition '<span style='font-family:courier'>($number < 0) && ($eps <= 0)</span>' holds true,  in Event '<em>invalid input</em>' the Message '<em>GetSquareRootResponse</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.SquareRoot</em>' is sent. <span style='color:gray'>In case of invalid input, the return value will be zero. Further, an error message is returned.</span> <br>
		If no condition applies, by default  a number of elements are executed in sequence. <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
			First,  the  Task '<em>initializevariables</em>' is performed. <span style='color:gray'>This initializes the variables: The upper and lower bounds and the currently tested number.</span> <br>
			Next,  starting at the Gateway '<em>_2</em>',  a part of the Process will be conducted in a loop.  At first,  a number of elements are executed in sequence. <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
				First,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>script</span> Task '<em>print</em>' is accomplished, running a script. <span style='color:gray'>Here, the currently tested number is printed. The script's body can not be translated to BPEL, thus this works only when translating to JIAC.</span> <br>
				Following that,  the  Task '<em>calculate delta</em>' is executed. <span style='color:gray'>Delta is the difference between the input number and the square of the currently tested number.</span> <br>
				
			</div>
			Next,  the loop condition will be tested. While the condition <span style='font-family:courier'>(($d < 0) && ((0 - $d) > $eps)) || (($d > 0) && ($d > $eps))</span> holds true, the loop will continue and  starting at the Gateway '<em>too large?</em>',  one out of several branches will be executed: <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
				If the condition '<span style='font-family:courier'>($current*$current) > $number</span>' holds true,  the  Task '<em>try smaller number</em>' is carried out. <span style='color:gray'>The currently tested number is used as the new upper bound and is then set to be the average of itself and the lower bound.</span> <br>
				If no condition applies, by default  the  Task '<em>try greater number</em>' is conducted. <span style='color:gray'>The currently tested number is used as the new lower bound and is then set to be the average of itself and the upper bound.</span> <br>
				
			</div>
			<br>
			Thereafter,  in Event '<em>return result</em>' the Message '<em>GetSquareRootResponse</em>' of the Service '<em>TestService.SquareRoot</em>' is sent. <span style='color:gray'>Returns the result of the approximation and a success message.</span> <br>
