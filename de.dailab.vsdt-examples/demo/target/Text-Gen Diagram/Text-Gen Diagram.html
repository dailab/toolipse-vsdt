		This Diagram is used for testing the Text Generation Capabilities of the VSDT. Here the focus is not so much on executability but on good documentation.
		
		<h2>Answering Support Call</h2>
		<span class='gen_doc'>This Business Process is about handling incoming support calls.</span>
		
		<h3>Customer Support</h3>
		<span class='gen_doc'>This Pool illustrates the process of Customer Support.</span>
		The Pool '<em>Customer Support</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Customer Support</em>'. This Pool is made up of 2 Lanes:<ul>
			<li><em>Help Desk</em>: <span class='gen_doc'>This Lane represents the Help Desk, which receives all incoming trouble tickets and will look up the answers for known problems or escalate the ticket to the technical support.</span></li>
			<li><em>Technical Support</em>: <span class='gen_doc'>The Technical Support receives tickets that can not be handled by the help desk, e.g. new problems.</span></li>
			
		</ul>
		The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>private</span>. In that Process,  a number of elements are processed in sequence. <div class='gen_block'>
			First,  in Event '<em>Receive Ticket</em>' the Message '<em>HelpDeskQuestion</em>' of the Service '<em>CS.askHelpdesk</em>' is received. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
			Afterwards,  starting at the Gateway '<em>Known Problem?</em>',  one out of several branches will be accomplished: <div class='gen_block'>
				If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>'unknown problem'</span>' holds true,  a number of elements are performed in sequence. <div class='gen_block'>
					First,  an interruptable region begins.<div class='gen_block'>
						 Here,  the <span class='gen_type'>manual</span> Task '<em>Try to reproduce Problem</em>' is conducted. <span class='gen_doc'></span>  This section can be interrupted if  in Event '<em>Timeout</em>'  the Activity is interrupted after <span class='gen_code'>'30 minutes'</span>. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
					</div>
					
					Hereafter,  a number of elements are accomplished in sequence. <div class='gen_block'>
						First,  starting at the Gateway '<em>Kind of Problem?</em>',  one or more out of several branches will be carried out: <div class='gen_block'>
							If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>'is bug'</span>' holds true,  the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Inform Developer</em>' is processed, sending the Message '<em>BugTrackerTicket</em>' which belongs to the Service '<em>Dev.fileBug</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
							If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>'is stupid user'</span>' holds true,  the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>Describe Solution</em>' is performed, invoking a Service. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
							
						</div>
						
						After that,  the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Add to Database</em>' is conducted, sending a Message. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
						
					</div>
					 This part will only be carried out if the <span class='gen_type'>timer</span> Event '<em>Timeout</em>' has not been triggered
					
				</div>
				
				If no condition applies, by default  the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>Look up answer in Database</em>' is performed, invoking the Service '<em>Database.getEntry</em>' with the input Message <em>getEntryRequest</em> and the output Message <em>getEntryResponse</em>. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
				
			</div>
			
			Hereupon,  the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Send Answer</em>' is carried out, sending the Message '<em>HelpDeskResponse</em>' which belongs to the Service '<em>CS.askHelpdesk</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
			Hereafter,  the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>File Ticket</em>' is conducted, invoking a Service. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
			Next,  in Event '<em>End Process</em>'  nothing special happens. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
			
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Development</h3>
		<span class='gen_doc'>This Pool stands for the Development department, being further distinguished into bugfixing and others.</span>
		The Pool '<em>Development</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Development</em>'. The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>collaboration</span>. In that Process,  a number of elements are conducted in sequence. <div class='gen_block'>
			First,  in Event '<em>Receive Bug</em>' the Message '<em>BugTrackerTicket</em>' of the Service '<em>Dev.fileBug</em>' is received. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
			Afterwards,  an interruptable region begins.<div class='gen_block'>
				 Here,  the ad-hoc <span class='gen_type'>embedded</span> Subprocess '<em>Work day and night to fix the bug</em>' is performed. In this course,  the <span class='gen_type'>manual</span> Task '<em>Code</em>' is performed. <span class='gen_doc'></span> Furthermore,  the <span class='gen_type'>manual</span> Task '<em>Get Coffee</em>' is accomplished. <span class='gen_doc'></span> Aside from that,  the normal flow and the exceptional flow are merged in the Gateway '<em>INITIAL_GATEWAY</em>'., which references to another Process in another Business Process Diagram. <span class='gen_doc'></span>  This section can be interrupted if  in Event '<em>Go insane</em>'  an error with error code '<span class='gen_code'>nuts</span>' is caught. <span class='gen_doc'>The poor developer went insane.</span>  In this case,  the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Inform HR</em>' is processed, sending a Message. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
			</div>
			
			Hereupon,  the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>Mark bug as being resolved</em>' is conducted, invoking a Service. <span class='gen_doc'></span>  This part will only be performed if the <span class='gen_type'>error</span> Event '<em>Go insane</em>' has not been triggered
			After that,  the normal flow and the exceptional flow are merged.
			Following that,  nothing special happens. <span class='gen_doc'></span> 
			
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Customer</h3>
		<span class='gen_doc'>This is a blackbox Pool which represents the customer making the call at the help desk. No internal process is shown for this Pool.</span>
		The Pool '<em>Customer</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Customer</em>'. The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>abstract</span>.
