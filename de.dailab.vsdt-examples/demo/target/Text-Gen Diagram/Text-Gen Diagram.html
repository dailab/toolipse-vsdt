		<h2 id="_fvliInz4Ed6pGOp9FzmQww">Answering Support Call</h2>
		<span class='gen_doc'>This Business Process is about handling incoming support calls.</span>
		
		<h3 id="_yxZuwAzBEd6Oi9RfBDu6Tw">Customer Support</h3>
		The Pool '<em>Customer Support</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Customer Support</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'>This Pool illustrates the process of Customer Support.</span>
		This Pool is made up of 2 Lanes:
		<ul>
			<li><em>Help Desk</em>: <span class='gen_doc'>This Lane represents the Help Desk, which receives all incoming trouble tickets and will look up the answers for known problems or escalate the ticket to the technical support.</span></li>
			<li><em>Technical Support</em>: <span class='gen_doc'>The Technical Support receives tickets that can not be handled by the help desk, e.g. new problems.</span></li>
			
		</ul>
		The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>private</span>. In this Process, a number of elements are executed in sequence. 
		<div class='gen_block'>
			First, in Event '<em>Receive Ticket</em>', the Message '<em>HelpDeskQuestion</em>' of the Service '<em>CS.askHelpdesk</em>' is received. <span class='gen_doc'>In the ticket the customer describes his poblem.</span> 
			After that, starting at the Gateway '<em>Known Problem?</em>', one out of several branches will be accomplished: 
			<div class='gen_block'>
				If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>'unknown problem'</span>' holds true, a number of elements are performed in sequence. 
				<div class='gen_block'>
					First, an interruptable region begins. 
					<div class='gen_block'>
						Here, the <span class='gen_type'>manual</span> Task '<em>Try to reproduce Problem</em>' is performed. <span class='gen_doc'>The support crew will try to reproduce the problem as described in the problem ticket. Depending on the outcome, further steps are taken.</span> This section can be interrupted if in Event '<em>Timeout</em>', the Activity is interrupted after <span class='gen_code'>'30 minutes'</span>. <span class='gen_doc'>The problem could not be reproduced after a reasonable time of trying to do so.</span> 
					</div>
					
					Afterwards, a number of elements are performed in sequence. 
					<div class='gen_block'>
						First, starting at the Gateway '<em>Kind of Problem?</em>', one or more out of several branches will be processed: 
						<div class='gen_block'>
							If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>'is bug'</span>' holds true, the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Inform Developer</em>' is processed, sending the Message '<em>BugTrackerTicket</em>' which belongs to the Service '<em>Dev.fileBug</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'>The problem turned out to be a bug in the system. In this case the technical support crew will create a bug report and send it to the development team.</span> 
							If the condition '<span class='gen_code'>'is stupid user'</span>' holds true, the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>Describe Solution</em>' is carried out, invoking a Service. <span class='gen_doc'>The problem turned out to be a usage problem. Describe a detailled solution what the user did wrong and how to do it better.</span> 
							
						</div>
						
						Thereafter, the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Add to Database</em>' is performed, sending a Message. <span class='gen_doc'>The solution to the problem is added to the data base of known problems and solutions, so it can be simply looked up in case the problem occures again.</span> 
						
					</div>
					This part will only be conducted if the <span class='gen_type'>timer</span> Event '<em>Timeout</em>' has not been triggered. 
					
				</div>
				
				If no condition applies, by default the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>Look up answer in Database</em>' is carried out, invoking the Service '<em>Database.getEntry</em>' with the input Message <em>getEntryRequest</em> and the output Message <em>getEntryResponse</em>. <span class='gen_doc'>The problem turned out to be a known problem and the answer can be looked up in some sort of problem-solution-database.</span> 
				
			</div>
			
			Hereupon, the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Send Answer</em>' is processed, sending the Message '<em>HelpDeskResponse</em>' which belongs to the Service '<em>CS.askHelpdesk</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'>The solution to the problem is sent back to the customer.</span> 
			Next, the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>File Ticket</em>' is carried out, invoking a Service. <span class='gen_doc'>The ticked is filed, so it can be used for statistical purposes, such as which problems occured how often and from what kinds of users.</span> 
			Thereafter, in Event '<em>End Process</em>', nothing special happens. <span class='gen_doc'>The process terminates.</span> 
			
		</div>
		
		
		<h3 id="_hK98MAzEEd6Oi9RfBDu6Tw">Development</h3>
		The Pool '<em>Development</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Development</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'>This Pool stands for the Development department, being further distinguished into bugfixing and others.</span>
		The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>collaboration</span>. In this Process, a number of elements are performed in sequence. 
		<div class='gen_block'>
			First, in Event '<em>Receive Bug</em>', the Message '<em>BugTrackerTicket</em>' of the Service '<em>Dev.fileBug</em>' is received. <span class='gen_doc'>The decelopment team receives a bug report and immediately drops everything else to fix the bug.</span> 
			After that, starting at the Gateway '<em>Work day and night to fix the bug__MERGE__</em>', a part of the Process will be conducted in a loop. 
			<div class='gen_block'>
				At first, an interruptable region begins. 
				<div class='gen_block'>
					Here, the ad-hoc <span class='gen_type'>embedded</span> Subprocess '<em>Work day and night to fix the bug</em>' is processed. <span class='gen_doc'>The heroic programmer works day and night looking for a treatment to the bug, resting only for an occasional travel to the coffee machine...</span> In its course, the <span class='gen_type'>manual</span> Task '<em>Code</em>' is conducted. <span class='gen_doc'>The programmer hacks away, trying to fix the problem.</span> Aside from that, the <span class='gen_type'>manual</span> Task '<em>Get Coffee</em>' is performed. <span class='gen_doc'>All work and not coffee makes programmer go insane.</span> This section can be interrupted if in Event '<em>Nuts</em>', an error with error code '<span class='gen_code'>nuts</span>' is caught. <span class='gen_doc'>Finally the poor developer went insane.</span> In this case, a number of elements are performed in sequence. 
					<div class='gen_block'>
						First, the <span class='gen_type'>send</span> Task '<em>Inform HR</em>' is performed, sending a Message. <span class='gen_doc'>Inform human resources about the new job opening.</span> 
						Afterwards, in Event '<em>Bug not fixed</em>', nothing special happens. <span class='gen_doc'>The process ends, but the bug could not be fixed.</span> 
						
					</div>
					More over, it can be interrupted if in Event '<em>Hungry</em>', the Activity is interrupted when a Rule applies. <span class='gen_doc'>The programmer notices an urge for pizza.</span> In this case, the <span class='gen_type'>manual</span> Task '<em>Get Pizza</em>' is processed. <span class='gen_doc'>Apart from coffee, pizza is the only thing the programmer needs to live.</span> 
				</div>
				Afterwards, the loop condition will be tested. While the condition <span class='gen_code'>! Work day and night to fix the bug_Hungry_normalCompletion</span> holds true, the loop will continue and the  Task '<em>__DO_NOTHING__</em>' is conducted.  
			</div>
			
			Thereafter, a number of elements are carried out in sequence. 
			<div class='gen_block'>
				First, the <span class='gen_type'>user</span> Task '<em>Mark bug as being resolved</em>' is accomplished, invoking a Service. <span class='gen_doc'>Finally, the bug has been fixed and can be marked as resolved in the bug report.</span> 
				Hereupon, in Event '<em>Bug fixed</em>', nothing special happens. <span class='gen_doc'>The process ends with the bug being fixed.</span> 
				
			</div>
			This part will only be conducted if the <span class='gen_type'>error</span> Event '<em>Nuts</em>' has not been triggered. 
			Thereafter, the normal flow and the exceptional flow are merged in the Gateway '<em>__FINAL_GATEWAY__</em>'. 
			
		</div>
		
		
		<h3 id="_4-HEcAzIEd6UAPS6PsSOjQ">Customer</h3>
		The Pool '<em>Customer</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Customer</em>'. <span class='gen_doc'>This is a blackbox Pool which represents the customer making the call at the help desk. No internal process is shown for this Pool.</span>
		The Pool's Process is of type <span class='gen_type'>abstract</span>.
