This Diagram is used for testing the Text Generation Capabilities of the VSDT. Here the focus is not so much on executability but on good documentation.<br>

<h2>Answering Support Call</h2>
This Business Process is about handling incoming support calls.<br>

<h3>Customer Support</h3>
This Pool illustrates the process of Customer Support.<br>
The Pool '<em>Customer Support</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Customer Support</em>'. This Pool is made up of 2 Lanes:<ul>
	<li><em>Help Desk</em>: This Lane represents the Help Desk, which receives all incoming trouble tickets and will look up the answers for known problems or escalate the ticket to the technical support.</li>
	<li><em>Technical Support</em>: The Technical Support receives tickets that can not be handled by the help desk, e.g. new problems.</li>
	
</ul>
The Pool's Process is of type <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>private</span>. In that Process,  a number of elements are performed in sequence. <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
	First,  in Event '<em>Receive Ticket</em>' the Message '<em>HelpDeskQuestion</em>' of the Service '<em>CS.askHelpdesk</em>' is received  from Participant <em>Customer</em>.  <br>
	Afterwards,  starting at the Gateway '<em>Known Problem?</em>',  one out of several branches will be performed: <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
		If the condition '<span style='font-family:courier'>unknown problem</span>' holds true,  a number of elements are carried out in sequence. <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
			First,  an interruptable region begins.<div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
				 Here,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>manual</span> Task '<em>Try to reproduce 
Problem</em>' is accomplished.   This section can be interrupted if  in Event '<em>Timeout</em>'  the Activity is interrupted after <span style='font-family:courier'>30 minutes</span>.  
			</div>
			<br>
			Hereafter,  a number of elements are conducted in sequence. <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
				First,  starting at the Gateway '<em>Bug or Usage Problem?</em>',  one or more out of several branches will be processed: <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
					If the condition '<span style='font-family:courier'>is bug</span>' holds true,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>send</span> Task '<em>Add to 
Bugtracker</em>' is performed, sending the Message '<em>BugTrackerTicket</em>' which belongs to the Service '<em>Dev.fileBug</em>'.  <br>
					If the condition '<span style='font-family:courier'>is stupid user</span>' holds true,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>user</span> Task '<em>Describe 
Solution</em>' is executed, invoking a Service.  <br>
					
				</div>
				<br>
				Hereafter,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>send</span> Task '<em>Add to 
Database</em>' is performed, sending a Message.  <br>
				
			</div>
			 This part will only be conducted if the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>timer</span> Event '<em>Timeout</em>' has not been triggered<br>
			
		</div>
		<br>
		If no condition applies, by default  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>user</span> Task '<em>Look up answer 
in Database</em>' is executed, invoking the Service '<em>Database.getEntry</em>' with the input Message <em>getEntryRequest</em> and the output Message <em>getEntryResponse</em>.  <br>
		
	</div>
	<br>
	Hereafter,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>send</span> Task '<em>Send 
Answer</em>' is performed, sending the Message '<em>HelpDeskResponse</em>' which belongs to the Service '<em>CS.askHelpdesk</em>'.  <br>
	Hereafter,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>user</span> Task '<em>File 
Ticket</em>' is carried out, invoking a Service.  <br>
	After that,  in Event '<em>End Process</em>'  nothing special happens.  <br>
	
</div>
<br>

<h3>Development</h3>
This Pool stands for the Development department, being further distinguished into bugfixing and others.<br>
The Pool '<em>Development</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Development</em>'. The Pool's Process is of type <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>collaboration</span>. In that Process,  a number of elements are carried out in sequence. <div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
	First,  in Event '<em>Receive Bug</em>' the Message '<em>BugTrackerTicket</em>' of the Service '<em>Dev.fileBug</em>' is received  from Participant <em>Customer Support</em>.  <br>
	Afterwards,  an interruptable region begins.<div style='border-left:solid thin; margin-left: .5em; padding-left: .5em'>
		 Here,  the ad-hoc <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>embedded</span> Subprocess '<em>Work day and night to fix that stupid bug</em>' is executed. In this course,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>manual</span> Task '<em>Code</em>' is executed.  Aside from that,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>manual</span> Task '<em>Get Coffee</em>' is processed.  , which references to another Process in another Business Process Diagram.   This section can be interrupted if  in Event '<em>Go insane</em>'  an error with error code '<span style='font-family:courier'>nuts</span>' is caught. The poor developer went insane.  In this case,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>send</span> Task '<em>Inform HR</em>' is accomplished, sending a Message.  
	</div>
	<br>
	Hereafter,  the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>user</span> Task '<em>Mark bug as 
being resolved</em>' is performed, invoking a Service.   This part will only be carried out if the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>error</span> Event '<em>Go insane</em>' has not been triggered<br>
	Thereafter,  the normal flow and the exceptional flow are merged.<br>
	Thereafter,  nothing special happens.  <br>
	
</div>
<br>

<h3>Customer</h3>
This is a blackbox Pool which represents the customer making the call at the help desk. No internal process is shown for this Pool.<br>
The Pool '<em>Customer</em>' belongs to Participant '<em>Customer</em>'. The Pool's Process is of type <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>abstract</span>.<br>
